 "text":"I've been telling people I'm working on a new dashboard for the TNT for a while now. Well, I got proof!\n\nFirst of all, the orange version is not finished yet. Think of it as an artists impression :)\n<p>\nI took a piece of MDF and cut out the basic shape for the dash. After deciding what to do with it, I cut it to pieces, and here's the result:<br>\n<img src=\"/img/mini/mdf-pre-dash.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"122\" vspace=\"2\" hspace=\"2\" border=\"0\"><br clear=\"all\">\n<br>\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"/img/mini/tweeterdetail.jpg\" width=\"187\" height=\"122\" border=\"0\">\nI bought some tiny tweeters for some extra audio-quality, and decided they should fit in the dash as well...<p>\nNow, all that's left is to do the paint-job, and then of course it must be fitted into the TNT!\n<p>\nHere's what it should look like once it's finished >>> \n<br clear=\"all\">\n<img src=\"/img/mini/orangedash.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"122\" vspace=\"2\" hspace=\"2\" border=\"0\">\n<br clear=\"all\">\n\n\n"
