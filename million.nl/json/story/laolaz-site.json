 "text":"A friend of mine started a new company, <a href=\"http://laolaz.million.nl\">Laolaz</a> (which sells <a href=\"http://laolaz.million.nl\">silk shawls, tapestries and silver jewelry</a>), and I helped him to build the website.\n\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://laolaz.million.nl\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://laolaz.million.nl/img/info/shawls.gif\"/></a>\nI did the design and coding, while he delivered the texts and product-info. Together, this resulted in the site which you can find on <a href=\"http://laolaz.million.nl\">http://laolaz.million.nl</a>. Besides the dutch version there is a version in the english language as well.\n<br/>\nThis company is no longer active, but if you wish to see try how it works without actually risking the placement of an order, all links now point to my local version at <a href=\"http://laolaz.million.nl\">http://laolaz.million.nl</a> and will send any mail (order, suggestions) to me instead of to Laolaz.\n\n"
